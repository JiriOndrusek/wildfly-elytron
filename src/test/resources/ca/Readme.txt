This folder contains an openssl based certificate authority used for testing.

To execute OpenSSL operations as the certificate authority first configure your environment: -

    . openssl.env

The password for the certificate authorities private key is 'Elytron'.

# jks

The 'jks' folder contains a number of keystores as used during testing, all have the password 'Elytron', 
entries use the same password.

ca.truststore - Contains the self signed root certificate of the certificate authority.

dung.keystore contains an alias 'dung'.
firefly.keystore contains an alias 'firefly'.
ladybird.keystore contains an alias 'ladybird'.
scarab.keystore contains an alias 'scarab'.
binary.keystore  contains an alias 'binary'.

# crl

The 'crl' folder contains different CRL files for this CA:

blank.pem is blank CRL for CA.
firefly-revoked.pem is CRL for CA, where certificate 'firefly' is revoked.
ica-revoked.pem is CRL for CA, where certificate of ICA is revoked.

# Creating a new keystore with CA signed certificates takes the following 5 steps: -
keytool -genkeypair -keystore jks/scarab.keystore -alias scarab -keyalg RSA -validity 3650
keytool -certreq -file scarab.csr -keystore jks/scarab.keystore -alias scarab
openssl ca -in scarab.csr
keytool -importcert -alias ca -file cacert.pkcs7 -keystore jks/scarab.keystore
keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -file certs/04.pem -alias scarab -keystore jks/scarab.keystore

# Revoking certificate and creating CRL
openssl ca -revoke certs/01.pem
openssl ca -gencrl -out crl/firefly-revoked.pem
